# Red-Bull-Aviators-Virtual-Experience-Program---On-premises-Sales-Analysis


### An Inferential analysis of a hypothetical dataset of randomly generated sales account from Red Bull using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.



This is a Virtual Experience Program found and completed on the Forage's website. It provided me the opportunity to step into the shoes of a typical Red Bull Sales Analytics team member and complete tasks that replicate the work done every day, learning how to perform sales accounts data analysis, how to communicate key trends/insights, how to close sales and how to overcome sales objections. The program is self-paced and typically takes 2-3 hours to complete. Necessary files associated with this program was uploaded too. There were two sections in the program with distinct objectives with associated learnable skills, viz:

1. Account Data Analysis: Here, the dataset was analyzed to identify key trends and opportunities for sales growth and also communicate insights from the findings. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Data Analysis, Data Presentation, and Communication Strategy

2. Overcoming Sales Objections: Here, the objections raised during the sales process were addressed using findings from the sales analysis which helped the company to close sale. Practical skills gain from working on this task are Sales closure, Overcoming Objections, Account Management and Communication.
