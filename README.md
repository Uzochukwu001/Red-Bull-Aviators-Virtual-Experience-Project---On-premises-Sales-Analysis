# Red-Bull-Aviators-Virtual-Experience-Program---On-premises-Sales-Analysis


## An Inferential analysis of a hypothetical dataset of randomly generated sales account from Red Bull using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.



This is a Virtual Experience Program found and completed on the Forage's website. It provided me the opportunity to step into the shoes of a typical Red Bull Sales Analytics team member and complete tasks that replicate the work done every day, learning how to perform sales accounts data analysis, how to communicate key trends/insights, how to close sales and how to overcome sales objections. The program is self-paced and typically takes 2-3 hours to complete. Necessary files associated with this program were uploaded which include:

- Certificate: This is the certificate awarded at the completion of this virtual experience program.
- Model Dataset from Red Bull: This is the dataset provided for analysis.
- Model Template for PowerPoint: This is the expected design template provided for after-analysis documentation.
- Red Bull Excel Project Solution: This is an excel workbook containing worksheets for the raw dataset, the transformed/cleaned dataset,pivot tables, and charts respectively.
- Model Answer(Video Recording Transcript): This is a copy of the response given to solve a Red Bull's customer concerns.


There were two sections in the program with distinct objectives as well as associated learnable skills, viz:

1. Account Data Analysis: Here, the dataset was analyzed to identify key trends and opportunities for sales growth and also communicate insights from the findings. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Data Analysis, Data Presentation, and Communication Strategy

2. Overcoming Sales Objections: Here, the objections raised during the sales process were addressed using findings from the sales analysis which helped the company to close sale. Practical skills gain from working on this task are Sales closure, Overcoming Objections, Account Management and Communication.


N.B. All relevant data cleaning and transformation processes for the different objectives, pivot tables and charts were already carried out on the attached excel project solution workbook. Below are the screenshots of the various charts indicating the solutions for the different objectives.

#### OVERCOMING SALES OBJECTION.

This section describes how I handled sales objection by one of the worst perfoming accounts, as indicated by the sales analysis and used insights from the analysis to convince her so as to achieve sales closure.

1. Account Attribute: This is the worst performing account with -53% CAGR in 5 years. She has small stock quantity of our product assortments and applies few marketing strategies.
2. Customer Concerns: She complained earlier that our products are quite expensive compared to other energy drinks. Also, she complained that her customers do not ask for our products from her bar.
3. Objective: Using a collaborative, pro-active, problem-solving, and personality-winning approach, send her a short video clip(2-3 minutes) suggesting reasons why you think she may have negative experiences with our products and also suggest solutions that can boost her sales experiences with our products positively.


- Below is a speech-to-text transcript copy of the message I sent, addressing the customer's concerns (The Red Bull's model answer for this section was uploaded also).


" Hi Lorena. My name is Uzochukwu Onwuegbu Vincent. I am a Red Bull Sales Representative. I called in to suggest few things around the concerns you raised to me last time, about our products.

In our last discussion, you mentioned our products are quite expensive compared to other energy drinks you sell and customers do not ask for our products in your bar. As part of our company values, I want to assure you that yor concerns are our concerns and also, your satisfaction and business success story is important to us as a company. So, here are the few things I think you can do to have a good experience with our products, which I shared with other customers who had similar challenges in the past but are currently having huge sales growth.

Energy drinks are fast-growing products especially for a point-of-sales business type like yours. We have discovered that customers usually prefer to patronise a business that have a variety of product choices which usually drives in more sales turnover compared to businesses with fewer product choices. I can show you the sales trend to support this statement if you would want that. You can try and stock up more varieties of our products which I believe is a game-changer for other people who had similar issues in the past.

Also, good business image and branding are key and somewhat tied to its success. To drive more customer patronage and sales of our products, I will suggest you start implementing some trendy marketing strategies such as digital screens, coolers, posters etc. for a business type like your bar. It worked for others and I think it can work for you too.

I really hope these suggestions can go a long way in helping your business drive in more sales. Feel free to also contact us if you have any other challenge and especially, I will like to hear your positive response as soon as possible. Thank you and have a good day, Lorena."




## CONCLUSION

This is an amazing experience for me as I discovered a new sales analysis technique using Compound Annual Growth Rate(CAGR) calculated on Microsoft Excel as well as learnt how to handle sales objections. The Completion Certificate for this program was uploaded.
